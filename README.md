## Overview 

The purpose of this project was to use webscraping in order to scrape data from various websites to be compiled into a flask application that delivers facts, images, and news about Mars. BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Python, MongoDB, Flask, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Pandas were used in this project to create the final product. Here is what our client has asked of us: 

> Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Webscraping 

Facts and News were scraped from the following website:
