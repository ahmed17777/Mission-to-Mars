## Overview 

The purpose of this project was to use webscraping in order to scrape data from various websites to be compiled into a flask application that delivers facts, images, and news about Mars. BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Python, MongoDB, Flask, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Pandas were used in this project to create the final product.
